### Redis' TTL Introduction

TTL in the context of Redis stands for "Time To Live." It refers to the amount of time a key-value pair will be stored in the Redis database before it expires and is automatically removed. Setting a TTL for keys in Redis is a way to control the lifespan of data in the cache.


### Set Key Expiration

SET myKey "Hello, Redis!"
EXPIRE myKey 60  # Set TTL to 60 seconds before expiration
or
SETEX myKey 60 "Hello, Redis!" # Set TTL to 60 seconds before expiration


### TTL Check State

TTL myKey # Check how many seconds myKey remains before it expires


### Setting TTL at the Time of Key Creation

SET myKey "Hello, Redis!" EX 60  # Set TTL to 60 seconds


### Persisting a key

PERSIST myKey #Remove TTL, no expiration


### TTL Info

TTL does not continue counting down its expiration time when Redis server is terminated
