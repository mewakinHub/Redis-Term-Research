# Pre-computing-system:

- store both compressed and uncompressed data on Redis with separating key!
- After compressing and storing data in Redis, initiate a pre-computing process to gather relevant metrics.

### Pre-computing process theorem.

1. **Metrics Collection:**
    - Fetch the compressed data from Redis.
    - compressed: Measure the time it takes to query and decompress the data from Redis.
    - uncompressed: Measure the time it takes to query the data from Redis.
2. **Decision Logic:**
    - Compare the response time of querying and decompressing the data with the original response time of fetching on both compression and uncompressed data from Redis.
    - If the decompression overhead is significantly higher than the original response time, consider storing uncompressed data in Redis for better retrieval performance
3. **global variable for indicate whether to unzip or not(cache hit):**
    - const zip_status = false;
    - change between true and false after compare the measurement to indicate whether function to use when cache hit
    - if zip_status = true { unzip + … }
    else { use directly + … }

### Reality

in reality, we have to zip and unzip it, with many additional step such as convert to base64 or unzipping file, so overhead from this make literally every case slower.

so, we’re not using zip right now!

However, you can implement this theorem in future that has more technology on zip and unzip!
Also, Fine-tune the thresholds based on your specific use case and performance requirements!

# Pre-computing System: A Guide to Efficient Data Storage and Retrieval

In today's data-driven world, storing and retrieving data efficiently is crucial for ensuring optimal performance. One approach to achieving this is through the use of a pre-computing system, where both compressed and uncompressed data are stored in a Redis database with separate keys. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of a pre-computing system and discuss its benefits.

## The Pre-computing Process Theorem

The pre-computing process involves several key steps to gather relevant metrics and make informed decisions about data storage and retrieval. Let's break down these steps:

1. **Metrics Collection**: The first step is to fetch the compressed data from the Redis database. Measurements are taken for both the time it takes to query and decompress the data from Redis (compressed) and the time it takes to query the data directly from Redis (uncompressed).
2. **Decision Logic**: The next step is to compare the response time of querying and decompressing the data with the original response time of fetching both compressed and uncompressed data from Redis. If the decompression overhead is significantly higher than the original response time, it may be more efficient to store the data uncompressed in Redis for better retrieval performance.
3. **Global Variable for Cache Hit**: To optimize cache hit efficiency, a global variable, such as `zip_status`, can be used. This variable is initially set to `false`. After comparing the measurements, if the decompression overhead is found to be minimal, the variable can be changed to `true`. This change indicates whether the data should be uncompressed (if `zip_status` is `true`) or used directly (if `zip_status` is `false`) when a cache hit occurs.

## Reality Check

In practice, implementing compression and decompression can introduce additional steps, such as converting data to base64 or unzipping files. These steps can result in overhead that slows down the overall process. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the specific use case and performance requirements before deciding to use compression.

To validate the effectiveness of compression, experiments can be conducted to measure the performance of both compressed and uncompressed data retrieval. The results of these experiments can guide the decision-making process and help fine-tune the thresholds for compression based on individual needs.

In conclusion, while a pre-computing system with compression can offer benefits in terms of storage efficiency, its effectiveness depends on various factors. By carefully considering the trade-offs and conducting experiments, it is possible to optimize data storage and retrieval for specific use cases.
