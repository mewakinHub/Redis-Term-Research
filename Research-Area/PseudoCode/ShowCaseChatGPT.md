To demonstrate the benefits of caching and the effectiveness of your optimization algorithm, you can create a simple scenario where an image is requested, measure the query time and size, and showcase the improvements achieved by caching and your algorithm. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Scenario:

1. **Original Image Request:**
   - Initiate a request for a specific image without caching.
   - Measure the query time and size using POSTMAN.
   - Record the results.

2. **Cached Image Request:**
   - Cache the same image.
   - Initiate a request for the cached image.
   - Measure the query time and size using POSTMAN.
   - Compare the results with the original request.

3. **Optimized Image Request:**
   - Apply your optimization algorithm to the image.
   - Cache the optimized image.
   - Initiate a request for the optimized and cached image.
   - Measure the query time and size using POSTMAN.
   - Compare the results with both the original and cached requests.

4. **Render Time:**
   - Additionally, measure the render time of the image on a webpage or application for each scenario.
   - Showcase how image compression and optimization contribute to faster render times.

### Visualization:

1. **Bar Chart for Query Time:**
   - Create a bar chart comparing the query times for the original, cached, and optimized requests.
   - Clearly illustrate the reduction in query time with caching and further improvement with optimization.

2. **Bar Chart for Data Size:**
   - Create a bar chart comparing the data sizes for the original, cached, and optimized responses.
   - Highlight the reduction in data size achieved by caching and the additional optimization.

3. **Line Chart for Render Time:**
   - Create a line chart depicting the render times for the original, cached, and optimized images.
   - Emphasize how optimization not only improves query times and data size but also contributes to faster rendering.

4. **Before-and-After Image Comparison:**
   - Present a visual comparison of the original image and the optimized image to showcase any perceptual differences.
   - Optionally, include a slider or toggle for an interactive experience.

5. **Narrative Explanation:**
   - Accompany the visualizations with a narrative that explains the significance of each step, emphasizing the benefits of caching and the specific improvements achieved by your optimization algorithm.

### Example Visualization (Simplified):

```plaintext
------------------   ------------------   ------------------
| Original Image | → |   Cached Image  | → | Optimized Image |
------------------   ------------------   ------------------
          |                |                    |
          ↓                ↓                    ↓
     Measure Query     Measure Query       Measure Query
     Time and Size      Time and Size        Time and Size
          |                |                    |
------------------   ------------------   ------------------

          |                |                    |

|  Data Size      |   |  Data Size      |   |  Data Size      |
------------------   ------------------   ------------------
          |                |                    |
------------------   ------------------   ------------------
| Line Chart for  |   | Line Chart for   |   | Line Chart for   |
| Render Time     |   | Render Time     |   | Render Time     |
------------------   ------------------   ------------------
```

### Note:

- **Interactive Presentation:**
  - If possible, create an interactive presentation where the professor can toggle between images, view charts, and understand the impact of caching and optimization visually.

- **Use Realistic Data:**
  - Use actual images and data relevant to your research to provide a realistic demonstration.

- **Explain Optimization Choices:**
  - In your narrative explanation, clarify the specific optimization techniques applied and how they contribute to the observed improvements.

- **Quantify Improvements:**
  - Quantify the improvements in terms of percentage reductions in query time and data size to highlight the tangible benefits.

This approach allows for a visual and interactive demonstration of the improvements achieved through caching and your optimization algorithm, making it more engaging and easier to understand for your professor.
